# ASPeL Workspace

Monorepo for the ASPeL project. This repository uses NPM Workspaces to manage multiple packages efficiently and `concurrently` to run scripts across these packages simultaneously.

ðŸš§ Work In Progress ðŸš§

This repo is currently being converted from a submodule repository to an inline code respository. While the conversion is in progress, check for the ðŸš§ next to any instructions you read as these may no longer be relevant if the submodule you are developing in has already been converted to inline code.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or later)

## Install

### Credentials

You will need to have some authentication tokens set to install modules from home office repositories. Create an `.env` file which looks like this:

```
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=ghp_oam...
ART_AUTH_TOKEN=eyJ2ZX...
```

The GitHub auth token should be a personal access token with read access on private repositories.

The artefactory auth token should be sourced from a member of the developer team.

### Quick start

```sh
npm run reset
```

### Manually

1. **Clone the repository**:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules  https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/aspel-workspace
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```sh
export $(cat .env) && npm install
```
   
3. **ðŸš§ Working on a ticket ðŸš§**

Each repo's CI/CD expect package-lock.json, when you are working on a ticket you should commit the changes with package-lock.json for a successful build. If you notice the workspace splits out common dependencies in the root's node_modules folder which is not checked in and not a part of the submodule. When committing code from a repo use

```
  npm install || npm install --package-lock-only
```

4. **InteliJ IDE**

Troubleshoot: After cloning the repo, you will see all the repositories in the packages folder. Check git settings and align manually.

```
  IDE settings => version control => directory mapping => click + Add and add the packages from the aspel-workspace/packages location. 
```

After this, you will see git show in IDE plugins.

## Run

**asl** and **asl-internal-ui** are the services you will typically be running in an IDE environment. You can start these automatically with:

```sh
npm run dev
```

To customise the services which will be run when executing this command, add a space separated environment variable to your `.env` file:

```sh
DEV_SERVICES="asl asl-internal-ui asl-internal-api"
```

Once services have been started, the ideal way so far we discovered is to run the [**asl-conductor**](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/asl-conductor) with this script:

```sh
npm start -- --local asl --local asl-internal-ui
```

## Useful Commands

- **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
- **Run a script in a specific package:** `npm run <script> -w <package_name>`
- **Run a script in monorepo root:** `npm run <script>`
- **Add a dependency to a specific package:** `npm install <dependency_name> -w <package_name>`
- **ðŸš§ Checkout master/main in all submodules ðŸš§:** `git submodule foreach 'git checkout main || git checkout master'`
- **ðŸš§ Pull latest changes in all branches ðŸš§:** `git submodule foreach git pull`

## NPM Workspaces

### Configuration

The workspace configuration is defined in the root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "aspel-workspace",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "packages/*"
  ]
}
```

### Adding Dependencies

To add a dependency to a specific package:

```sh
npm install <dependency_name> -w <package_name>
```

To add a dependency to the monorepo:

```sh
npm install <dependency_name>
```

This second command should not be used to install dependencies required by our sub packages. Only dependencies used by the monorepo root (for CI/test/scripting e.t.c).

### Removing Dependencies

To remove a dependency from a specific package:

```sh
npm uninstall <dependency_name> -w <package_name>
```

To remove a dependency from the monorepo:

```sh
npm uninstall <dependency_name>
```

This second command will not remove depdencies from sub packages if they are also declared there. Only dependencies in the monorepo root `package.json`.

### Running Scripts

To run a script in a specific package:

```sh
npm run <script> -w <package_name>
```

To run a script for the monorepo:

```sh
npm run <script>
```

This second command will only run scripts declared in the root `package.json`, not in sub packages.

## Tips and Tricks

### ESLint

ESLint relative extends don't work in both the workspace and CI/CD at the same time, as the installation path changes 
between the two. The rules have been moved to `@ukhomeoffice/eslint-config-asl`, so if a module hasn't been updated yet
update the package.json to use `"@ukhomeoffice/eslint-config-asl": "^3.0.0"` and update .eslintrc to 

```yaml
extends:
  - "@ukhomeoffice/asl"
```

You can get ESLint feedback and automatic fixes as you work in IntelliJ. Go to IntelliJ settings > Languages & 
Frameworks > JavaScript > ESLint. Change the radio group to "Automatic ESLint configuration", and check 
"Run eslint --fix on save".

### ðŸš§ Git Commit | PR ðŸš§

Please ensure the `package-lock.json` is available when you are committing. Bump up the `package.json` version along with the changes. Once you are happy with the work, always reset the workspace and stash changes to prevent workspace breakage.

To reset the workspace, delete the `node_modules` folder in `packages/*` so that when you re-run the command below, it recreates the dependency tree suitable for the workspace:

```sh
yarn run dev
```
