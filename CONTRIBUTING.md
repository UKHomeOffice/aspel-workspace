Thank you for your interest in contributing to ASPeL! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start for New Contributors

### First Time Contributing to Open Source?
Welcome! We're excited to have you. Here are some beginner-friendly ways to get started:

1. **Good First Issues**: Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` or `beginner-friendly`
2. **Documentation**: Help improve our documentation, fix typos, or add examples
3. **Testing**: Write tests for existing functionality
4. **Bug Reports**: Report bugs you find while using the system

### Understanding the Codebase
- **Frontend**: React applications in `packages/asl*` directories
- **Backend**: Node.js APIs and services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL schemas in `packages/asl-schema`
- **Shared**: Common utilities in `packages/asl-components` and `packages/asl-constants`

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment (see README.md)
4. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix

## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aspel-workspace.git
cd aspel-workspace

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start development
npm run dev
```

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes
3. Write or update tests as needed
4. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

5. Run linting:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

6. Format your code:
   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

### Commit Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Include more details in the body if needed

Example:
```
Add user authentication to API endpoints

- Implement JWT token validation
- Add middleware for protected routes
- Update documentation for auth requirements
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Push your changes to your fork
2. Create a pull request against the main repository
3. Fill out the pull request template
4. Ensure all checks pass
5. Respond to any feedback from reviewers

## Code Style

- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Update existing tests when modifying code
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting

## Documentation

- Update relevant documentation for your changes
- Include JSDoc comments for new functions
- Update README.md if adding new features

## Getting Help

- Open an issue for bugs or feature requests
- Ask questions in pull request comments
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
