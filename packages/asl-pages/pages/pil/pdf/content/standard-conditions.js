  `In exercising his or her responsibilities, the licence holder shall act at all times in a manner that is
  consistent with the principles of replacement, reduction and refinement.`,

  `The licence holder is entrusted with primary responsibility for the welfare of the animals on which he
  or she has performed regulated procedures; the licence holder must ensure that animals are properly
  monitored and cared for.`,

  `The licence holder must not apply a regulated procedure to an animal if the procedure may cause
  the animal severe pain, suffering or distress that is likely to be long-lasting and cannot be ameliorated.`,

  `The licence holder must not apply a regulated procedure to an animal unless the holder has taken
  precautions to prevent or reduce to the minimum consistent with the purposes of the procedure any pain,
  suffering, distress or discomfort that may be caused to the animal.`,

  `Where the licence holder is applying a regulated procedure to an animal the holder must ensure that
  any unnecessary pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm that is being caused to the animal is stopped.`,

  `Where the licence holder is applying or has applied a regulated procedure which is causing the
  animal severe pain, suffering or distress the holder must take steps to ameliorate that pain, suffering or
  distress.`,

  `The licence holder shall ensure that where the holder applies a regulated procedure death as the
  end-point of the procedure is avoided as far as possible and is replaced by an early and humane endpoint.`,

  `In all circumstances where an animal which is being, or has been, subjected to a regulated
  procedure is in severe pain, suffering or distress which is likely to be long-lasting and cannot be
  ameliorated, the licence holder must ensure that the animal is immediately killed in accordance with
  section 15A.`,

  `The licence holder may apply a regulated procedure without the use of general or local anaesthesia
  only if the holder is satisfied thatâ€”
  (a) the procedure will not inflict serious injuries capable of causing severe pain; and
  (b) the use of general or local anaesthesia would be more traumatic to the animal than the
  procedure itself or would frustrate the purposes of the procedure.`,

  `When anaesthesia (whether general or local) is used, it shall be of sufficient depth to prevent the
  animal from being aware of pain arising during the procedure.`,

  `If the licence holder applies a regulated procedure to an animal with the use of general or local
  anaesthesia the holder must, unless it would frustrate the purpose of the procedure, use such analgesics
  or other pain-relieving methods as may be necessary to reduce any pain that the animal may experience
  once the anaesthesia wears off.`,

  `The licence holder must use analgesia or another appropriate method to ensure that the pain,
  suffering and distress caused by regulated procedures are kept to a minimum.`,

  `It is the responsibility of the personal licence holder to notify the project licence holder as soon as
  possible when it appears either that the severity limit of any procedure listed in the project licence or that
  the constraints upon adverse effects described in the project licence have been or are likely to be
  exceeded.`,

  `The licence holder shall ensure that suitable arrangements exist for the care and welfare of animals
  during any period when the personal licence holder is not in attendance.`,

  `The licence holder shall ensure that, whenever necessary, veterinary advice and treatment are
  obtained for the animals in his or her care.`,

  `The licence holder shall ensure that all cages, pens or other enclosures are clearly labelled. The
  labelling must be such as to enable Inspectors, named veterinary surgeons and named animal care and
  welfare officers to identify the number of the project licence authorising the procedures, the project
  licence protocol in which the animals are being used, the date the protocol was started, and the
  responsible personal licence holder.`,

  `In order to ensure that regulated procedures are performed competently, the licence holder shall
  not apply regulated procedures unless given the appropriate level of supervision by the project licence
  holder or an experienced personal licence holder deputed by him/her for such time as may be needed to
  achieve competence.`,

  `The licence holder is authorised to delegate to assistants, who do not themselves possess the
  requisite personal licence authority but are under his or her control, the delegable tasks which form an
  integral part of the regulated procedures the licence holder is authorised to perform by this licence. The
  tasks must not require technical knowledge or skill, and delegation shall be in accordance with any
  relevant guidance published by the Secretary of State under section 21.`,

  `The licence holder must take all reasonable steps to ensure appropriate personal and project
  licence authorities exist before performing regulated procedures. The licence holder must be aware of
  the nature of the authorities given by this licence and the project licence, and of the conditions of issue
  attached to the licences.`,

  `The licence holder shall maintain a record of all animals on which procedures have been carried
  out, including details of supervision and declarations of competence by the project licence holder as
  appropriate. This record shall be retained for at least five years and shall, on request, be submitted to the
  Secretary of State or made available to an Inspector.`,

  `The licence holder must give any necessary assistance to inspectors carrying out visits by virtue of
  section 18(2A)(b) ; and to experts of the European Commission carrying out duties under Article 35 of
  the Animals Directive.`,

  `The licence remains the property of the Secretary of State, and shall be surrendered to him on
  request.`
