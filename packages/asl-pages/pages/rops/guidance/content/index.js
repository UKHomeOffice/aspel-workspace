* You will be asked to complete 4 sections of questions before adding details of completed procedures (if relevant). Answering these initial set up questions means you wonâ€™t be asked about information not relevant to your project later on.

* Data should be provided on each procedure, ie. each use of an animal. In most cases this means a single protocol.

* You should record the actual severity levels experienced by animals during procedures, even if these differ from what was projected in the licence.

* Include all procedures completed in {{year}} no matter when they started.

* Please note that some questions and options have changed from previous years.`
