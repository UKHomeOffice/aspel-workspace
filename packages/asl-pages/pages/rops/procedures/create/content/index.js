      If animals were used in the same procedure across multiple studies, you can give one figure for all the procedures
      carried out. However you should record the first use of theanimals separately to subsequent re-uses. Be sure to check
      the detailed guidance on reporting re-use to ensure you record the figures correctly.

      ### Tiny animals
      If tiny animals such as fish larvae were used, estimates are fine.

      ### Numbers over 999 and NHPs
      If the number of procedures is over 99 for NHPs, or 999 for any other animal, add a note to the Home Office explaining why (for example if you’ve given a single figure for multiple studies). If the number relates to animals used on the same breeding protocol simply state ‘Breeding’.`,
