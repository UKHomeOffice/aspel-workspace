  (4) The licence holder shall ensure that if a dog, cat or non-human primate kept at the establishment dies at that place, is set free from that place or is transferred otherwise than to a place specified in another section 2C licence, the individual history file for the animal is kept for a period of three years following its death, setting free or transfer.

  (5) A copy of any individual history file required to be kept by this condition shall, on request, be submitted to the Secretary of State or made available to an Inspector.`,

  `— The licence holder shall ensure that before any unmarked dog, cat or non-human primate is weaned at the place specified in the licence the animal is marked. The licence holder shall ensure that before any unmarked dog, cat or non-human primate that has not been weaned is transferred from the establishment to a place specified in another section 2C licence, the animal is marked unless it would not be reasonably practicable to do so. Where an unmarked dog, cat or non-human primate that has not been weaned is transferred to the establishment, the establishment shall maintain records attesting the identity and origin of the animal’s mother until the animal is marked.

  (a) only the types of protected animals specified in the licence may be kept in the place or places specified in the licence for the purpose of the regulated activities specified in the licence; and

  (b) for the purpose of the regulated activities specified in the licence, these animals may only be kept, bred and used in the areas listed in the schedule to the licence.`,

  `Records shall be maintained, in a format acceptable to the Secretary of State and under the supervision of the named veterinary surgeon, relating to the health of all protected animals bred, kept or used at the establishment for any regulated activities. Records shall, on request, be submitted to the Secretary of State or made available to an Inspector.`,

  `The licence holder shall nominate and be responsible for the performance of named persons, acceptable to the Secretary of State, as required by section 2C(5) .`,

The section 2C licence holder will, during that period, assume responsibility for ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions of the project licence.`,

  `— This condition applies where this licence authorises the applying of regulated procedures to protected animals.

  (1) A protected animal which, having been subjected to a completed series of regulated procedures, is kept alive shall continue to be kept at the establishment under the supervision of a veterinary surgeon or other suitably qualified person unless—

    (a) it is moved, with the authority of the Secretary of State, to another establishment;

    (b) the Secretary of State consents under section 17A to the animal no longer being kept at the establishment; or

    (c) its re-use in another procedure is authorised by the Secretary of State.`,
