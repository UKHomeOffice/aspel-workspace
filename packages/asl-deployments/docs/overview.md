## What is ASPeL?

Animals in Scientific Procedures - e-Licensing (ASPeL) is an online system for the application, issuing and management of licences for the use of animals in scientific procedures.

The current instance of ASPeL was launched in July 2019 following design and development over the preceding 2 years.

## Background

The use of animals in scientific procedures is regulated by the "Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986". This restricts the use of certain animal species - specifically vertebrates and cephalopods - in regulated scientific procedures. 

A regulated procedure is defined by the act as one "carried out on a protected animal for a scientific or educational purpose and may cause that animal a level of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm equivalent to, or higher than, that caused by inserting a hypodermic needle according to good veterinary practice".

Licences are issued and managed on behalf of the secretary of state by ASRU - the Animals in Science Regulatory Unit - operating within the Home Office.

## Types of licence

### Personal licence (PIL)

All individuals who carry out regulated procedures on animals must hold an individual licence (PIL).

This individual licence is associated with a specific establishment, although allowed the licence holder to carry out work at any licensed establishment.

Personal licences are granted indefinitely, but require a review every 5 years to ensure that the individual remains suitable to hold a licence.

#### Category E PILs

A special category of PIL is issued to individuals taking part in educational or training activity at a licensed training establishment. These are issued for 3 months at a time, and can be help in addition to a "normal" PIL.

### Establishment licence (PEL)

All regulated procedures must be carried out within a licensed establishment, under the authority of the establishment licence holder (PEL holder) or a Named Person Responsible for Compliance (NPRC)[^1]

#### Named people

As part of an establishment licence a number of "Named people" are required to be defined on the licence

* Named Veterinary Surgeon (NVS)[^2]
* Named Animal Care and Welfare Officer (NACWO)
* Named Information Officer (NIO)
* Named Training and Competency Officer (NTCO)

Most establishments also have an assigned Home Office Liaison Contact (HOLC) though this is not a licensed role required by the act.

#### Approved areas

All regulated work carried out at an establishment must take place within a location designated in the establishment licence, and approved by ASRU as being suitable for the particular purpose.

#### POLEs

The exception to this is that projects may define Places Other than Licensed Establishments (POLEs) which are locations outside of the licensed establishment premises (such as farms or wild animal habitats) where work can be allowed to take place.

### Project licence (PPL)

All regulated procedures carried out must be defined in a project licence (PPL). Each PPL is held by one individual (who may or may not also hold a PIL) and one establishment, who are responsible for ensuring work is carried out in compliance with the terms of the licence. Additional establishments can also be defined as part of a PPL where it is necessary for procedures to be be carried out in multiple locations.

PPL applications are reviewed by ASRU to ensure that the harm to animals is commensurate with the benefits expected to result from the work.

All PPL applications are also reviewed by an Animal Welfare Ethical Review Board (AWERB) before being granted by ASRU.

Project licences are granted for a limited period, not exceeding 5 years.

#### Returns of procedures

Each calendar year a Return of Procedures (RoP) must be submitted for each active project. This details the number of each type of animal used in procedures for each project, and the actual severities of these procedures.

This is completed for each project active in a calendar year and must be submitted before the end of January, or within 28 days of the end of the project, whichever is sooner.

#### Retrospective assessment

For some projects of special interest - for example using certain species, or with severe procedures - a retrospective assessment (RA) must be carried out following the end of a project licence.

This requires the project licence holder to report to the Home Office the outcomes of the project in reference to the stated objectives. This must be submitted within 6 months of the completion of the project.

#### Non-technical summaries

All project licence applications must also provide a non-technical summary (NTS). This is a summary of the objectives of the work, and implementation of the "three Rs"[^3].

## Notes

[^1]: The distinction between a PEL holder and NPRC is _unclear_. They seem to be different names for the same role.
[^2]: The NVS role can also be performed by a "Suitably Qualified Person" (SQP), which is an identical role, but where the person does not hold a veterinary surgery qualification.
