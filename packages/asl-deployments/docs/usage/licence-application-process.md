## Establishment licence

The process for creating and applying for a new PEL needs to be started by an ASRU user.

They can create a new draft establishment record and invite the first admin user to the establishment.

That admin user can then invite new users to join the establishment.

While the establishment is in the draft phase admin users can complete the establishment details and add the named roles and approved areas. These are submitted one at a time, and each reviewed individually by an ASRU inspector and added to the licence.

Once all aspects of the PEL are in place, an establishment admin can submit a request to grant the PEL. This does not require the submission of any further information as it is expected that all necessary data is in place having been previously assessed and approved.

## Personal licence

### Category A,B,C,D&F

A PIL can be applied for either by the licence holder themselves, or by an establishment admin acting on their behalf.

The applicant must provide details of any relevant training certificates they hold, the species with which they with to be licenced to perform procedures, and the procedure categories.

On submitting this information it must then be reviewed by the establishment NTCO and endorsed to confirm the applicant is suitable, and the establishment accepts responsibility for the licence fee.

Following endorsement by an NTCO the application is sent to a licensing officer within ASRU who can either grant, return or reject the application.

### Category E

Some establishments are marked as "training and education" establishments, and can also apply for category E licences. These are always applied for by an establishment admin, and are associated with a training course operating under a specific PPL.

First a training course is created, and then participants can be added to the training course.

For each licence holder the personal details are provided along with a statement of training need. This is then sent to the NTCO at the establishment for endorsement as per a normal PIL.

Once endorsed each participant's application is sent to an ASRU inspector for review, and they can grant, return or reject the application.

## Project licence

A PPL can be applied for either by the licence holder themselves, or by an establishment admin acting on their behalf.

Applicants can either create a completely new application or upload a template based on another PPL to create a draft application using the data from that PPL as a starting point.

The PPL application collects a large amount of data, and can be completed across multiple sessions and in any order. The applicant must mark each section as complete before submitting the application.

Once submitted, the PPL application must be reviewed and endorsed by an admin user at the project's primary establishment, who must also provide details of the AWERB review at the primary establishment as well as at any additional establishments.

If an admin user is submitting their own application - or submitting an application on behalf of another user - then their endorsement is performed at the point of submission.

Upon endorsement the application is sent to an ASRU inspector for review.

The inspector can add comments to any part of the application, and return it to the applicant for editing if required. The inspector has a statutory deadline of 40 working days from the submission of a project licence application to grant the licence, or to determine that it is not "complete and correct". In certain complex cases this deadline can be extended to 55 working days.

Additional internal processing targets are also maintained for project amendments and resubmissions.

If the application is returned to the applicant then a new copy of the application data is created and can be edited by the applicant. This allows the inspector to see changes between submissions and avoids the need to review the entire application on each submission.

## Training modules

As part of the application for PILs and PPLs the licence holder is required to provide details of any relevant training certificates that they hold. These are stored as part of the applicant's profile and so are preserved for use on any subsequent applications. They can also be managed independently of any licence applications in the user's profile.

## Amending and revoking licences

In general any user who can apply for a licence can also request changes to the licence, or the complete revocation of the licence.

These follow the same workflow to the granting process with a few small exceptions:

* PELs can only be revoked once all associated PILs and PPLs are either also revoked, or transferred to other establishments
* PILs and PPLs can only be transferred to another establishment by the licence holder, and only to establishment with which they are affiliated
* Some PPL amendments may be considered sufficiently minor as to not require review by an AWERB.
