Tasks in the system generally represent a request to grant or change a licence as it goes through the various steps required to be reviewed.

The exception to this is some actions - such as submitting a ROP, or changing the named people assigned to an approved area - that require no formal review, but where a task is created to show a record of the change.

All users have a task list on their home page which breaks tasks into three categories - "Outstanding", "In progress" and "Completed". ASRU users also have an additional category of "My tasks".

### Outstanding tasks

When a task is in a user's outstanding list it means that it is awaiting an action from that user. 

For an establishment user this could be an application[^1] that has been returned to them by ASRU, or one awaiting endorsement by a user with a particular role in the establishment.

For an ASRU user, this is an application[^1] awaiting their review to be granted.

ASRU users can also assign tasks to themselves or other users within in ASRU. When an outstanding task is assigned to a user it also appears in that user's "My tasks" list.

### In progress tasks

Tasks that are in a user's "In progress" list are those which are currently awaiting action from another user.

When a task is in progress, an establishment user with the appropriate level of permissions (i.e. an establishment admin, or the associated licence holder) can either recall the task to be edited and resubmitted, or discard it completely.

### Completed tasks

Completed tasks are those which can no longer be actioned by any user. This is generally because the application[^1] has been either granted or discarded by the applicant, but may also be because it was rejected outright by ASRU.

## Notes

[^1]: "application" is taken here to mean any request to grant, amend or revoke a licence, or any other action requiring review by ASRU.
