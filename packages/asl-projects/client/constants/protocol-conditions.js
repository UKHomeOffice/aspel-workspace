* AB general anaesthesia with recovery
* AC non-recovery general anaesthesia
* AD under neuromuscular blockade`,

  generalAnaesthesia: `### General anaesthesia

If authorised in this licence and unless otherwise specified, all animals are expected to make a rapid and unremarkable recovery from the anaesthetic within two hours. Uncommonly animals that fail to do so or exhibit signs of pain, distress or of significant ill health should be humanely killed unless a programme of enhanced monitoring and care is instituted until the animal fully recovers.`,

  surgery: `### Surgery

If authorised in this licence and unless otherwise specified:
* Surgical procedures should be carried out aseptically, to at least the published Home Office minimum;
* In the uncommon event of post-operative complications, animals will be humanely killed unless, in the opinion of a veterinary surgeon, such complications can be remedied promptly and successfully using no more than minor interventions. Minimally inflamed wounds without obvious infection may be re-closed on one occasion within 48 hours of the initial surgery. In the event of recurrence, NVS advice will be followed;
* Peri and post-operative analgesia will be provided; agents will be administered as agreed in advance with the NVS;
* All animals are expected to make a rapid and unremarkable recovery from the anaesthetic within two hours. Uncommonly animals that fail to do so or exhibit signs of pain, distress or of significant ill health will be humanely killed by a Schedule 1 method unless a programme of enhanced monitoring and care is instituted until the animal fully recovers;
* Any animal not fully recovered from the surgical procedure within 24 hrs (eating, drinking and return to normal behaviour) should be humanely killed.`,

  administration: `### Administration of substances and withdrawal of fluids

If authorised in this licence and unless otherwise specified, administration of substances and withdrawal of body fluids will be undertaken using a combination of volumes, routes, and frequencies that of themselves will result in no more than transient discomfort and no lasting harm using published guidelines on minimal severity.`
